### Title
- Moose and Drivers: Roadside Mineral Licks as a Hidden Hazard
- Exploring Moose Behaviour: Roadside Mineral Licks as Hidden Hazards for Drivers

### Introduction

- Moose often visit roadside mineral licks to consume de-icing salts, but this brings them close to traffic, increasing the risk of collisions. By understanding their behavior at these sites, we can develop strategies to reduce accidents and improve safety for both moose and drivers.


### Methods
- We used camera traps to monitor the moose behaviour of 5 roadside mineral licks

- From 2012 to 2020

### Results

- Common Behaviors: Moose primarily displayed vigilance (watching for threats) and licking (consuming salts).

- Timing of Collisions: Visits to roadside mineral licks peaked in mid-summer, with the highest activity at night. Vigilance was highest in May, and licking peaked in June.

- Who Visited: Cows with calves spent the most time at roadside mineral licks, followed by bulls, and then solitary cows.

### Conclusion

- Moose visits to roadside mineral licks, particularly at night and in mid-summer, heighten the risk of vehicle collisions. Implementing traffic warnings or modifying de-icing methods can help improve safety for both moose and drivers.
