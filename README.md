## Tools

I will be using these two platforms for designing: 

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/): an image editor for most of the visual design, including digital drawing.

- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/): a design tool for presentations and social media. I will be using canva for the text design. 

Example of my design style. Visit website for more: https://sunshineland.netlify.app/infographic/
